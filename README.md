Arduino reaction game 
This game was made by a 17 years old student, using it pleas remember that the code is not perfect.

This game was made using arduino uno. 
The millis make the code respond instantly. 
"SW" variables are physical switches.
"LED" variables are physical switches.

Functionality:
  The leds wil blink for a random amount of time. 
  When both leds stop blinking, the first person to press their button wins and their led is on all the time.
